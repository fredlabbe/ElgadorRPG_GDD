# **ElgadorRPG_GDD**
This is the website for my RPG game based on the universe I've been working on since 2011. My Concordia Computation Arts Application portfolio from 2019 was garnished with works, concept arts, maps, illustrations, etc. from this world I've been creating, but now I have added more to the library.  

## March 22nd 2023 250 words descriptive text:

This project examines the glorification of imperialism through a metaphorical game set in a fantasy medieval world. Elven ruins are explored and symbolize ancient empires (i.e. Roman, Chinese, English empires and many more) that are often glorified or looked at with mysticism often without taking into account their impact or treatment of local populations. Players will reflect on their own experience with real ancient empires while living through the glorification and mysticism of ancient Elven empires in the game.
This project positions itself as a Role-Playing Game based in a medieval fantasy setting where the player explores a small world inhabited by humans that is sparkled with foregone Elven ruins. These ruins are occupied by bandits which the player will have to clear the site of as a hired adventurer paid by human scholars which investigate the mysticism of these ancient Elven civilizations. I have been writing a book situated in this world since the past 12 years, and every university project I partake in tries to situate itself in this world.
**The game is made in Unity using the Game Kit Controller https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/game-kit-controller-40995**, animations have been downloaded from Mixamo https://www.mixamo.com/#/, mostly 3D modeled by me and textured in the Susbtance Painter Software or inside Blender itself.
I designed and modeled the whole environment, the trees, plants, rocks and buildings myself, along with the main character played in third person. Enemies and NPCs are either downloaded or bought and credited. The music is produced completely by myself, but the in-game sounds are taken from Splice. 


## Contemporary works:

This contemporary work is similar to the scale I envision for my project. A short game loop, a small map, enemies to fight, and, if time allows it, implementing a shopping system with armors. The major difference with it will be the artstyle, since the developper went for a low poly style to facilitate his programming, but since I am creating all the assets for this project in my 3D class, I will be able to have a more polished-looking product. 

### Skyrim by Bethesda Studios (2011)

Skyrim is and will probably forever stay my favorite game. It is a great example of a role playing game with a rich and vast world, revolutionizing the graphics, immersion and the overall RPG genre at the time of its release. The popularity of the game propelled the RPG genre so much that even larger series like Assassinâ€™s Creed moved away from their own genre and incorporated many more RPG elements in their own games. It is an inspiration for graphics, world design, worldbuilding, melee combat mechanics, dungeons, AI (which is a bit laggy and funny now but still has its charm and revolutionized the technology back then). The mission system, dialogue, leveling up, magic, enchantment, alchemy, crafting system, everything is very good for a company that was relatively small with a team of only 100 people. It is and will probably forever stay one of the most iconic RPG. 

## Historical Work: 
The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien (1937-1949)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit 

Tolkien created a whole new genre of stories with this work and set the ground for what would become the basis of any medieval fantasy story. He created the - now basic - races of the Humans, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Orcs, and so on and contributed to the basic stereotypes for what these races are supposed to look like, their personalities, their cultures, and more. The world building is so vast that the first The Lord of the Rings book The Fellowship of the Ring starts with more than 100 pages of description of the Hobbit race only. It is a major reference to anyone writing or creating in the Medieval Fantasy genre and will forever stay the most iconic work of that genre, which engendered the rise of many new ways of experiencing the genres as the technology developed, generating tabletop games, movies, TV series, and recently videogames.

## Credits 

**The programming was realized through the amazing work of the person behind the Game Kit Controller asset on the Unity Assets Store. It is a bank of modules already programmed, with many youtube tutorials available and a Discord Server where the creator is available everyday for help.**

The Main Character's face and hands models were bought and stripped from: 

The only textures made by me were the Main Characters', realized in Susbstance Painter. All the other textures were taken from Free PBR Textures, Poly Haven, 3D Textures, Ambient CG, etc. 

All the Trees, Rocks, bushes and nature models were made by me. 

All the buildings (City Walls, House, Mill, Ruins, Destroyed Ruins, Gazebo Ruins, Throne Ruin, etc.) were modeled by me and textured with the above website's resources. 

Theomir (the old man)'s model was bought from Turbosquid and Rigged by Mixamo and weight adjusted by me. 

The Bandits were taken from Mixamo. 

Galeran the Peasant (the peasant farm character)'s model was bought from CG Trader. 

Theomir's book was taken from the Unity Assets Store. 

The weapons were taken either from GKC or Free Medieval Weapons assets on Unity Assets Store.

In-game sounds taken from the GKC or from Splice.
